GassyFS Policy Engine
====================

The administrator can stuff Lua code in the inode to set policies. This lays the framework for file manifolds and a general programmable storage system. For more details, see our [architecture documentation](architecture.png).

Quickstart
==========

Use the `gassy-cmd` program to get/set policies:

```bash
./gassy-cmd
```
